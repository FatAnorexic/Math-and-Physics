# Description

A simple series designed to show young students how math may always build complexity, but it will always boil down to simple addition and subtraction.

It also has the added benefit of showing them the most basic syntax of coding in a C++ environment.

# Requirements

To run this, you'll only need a text editor or suite capable of compiling/virtually emulating C++ code.
