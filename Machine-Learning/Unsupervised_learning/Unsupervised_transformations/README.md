Unsupervised transformations of a dataset are algorithms that create a new
representation of the data which might be easier ffor humans or other machine learning algorithms to understand compared to the original representation of the data. A common application of unsupervised tranformations it dimensionality reduction, which takes a high-dimensional representation of the data, consisteing of many features and finds a new way to represent this data that summarizes the essential characteristics with fewer features
